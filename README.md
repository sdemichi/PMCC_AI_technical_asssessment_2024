# PMCC_AI_technical_asssessment_2024
This is the project directory for ongoing analyses in the technical assessment for the Computational Biology role as a part of the PMCC AI team at UHN. I enjoyed working on this project, and will continue to update results as they become available. Will incorporate as a finished product in my portfolio once complete.
