This repo contains all code and dependencies required for the implementation of DNABERT-2 (an updated version of the original DNABERT) for cell type prediction from DHS sequences, and downstream analyses. Conda environment created using instructions from https://github.com/MAGICS-LAB/DNABERT_2/tree/main.

Options in scripts for deep learning using the transformer model were adjusted according to the resources available (180GB RAM, 1 CPU, 0 GPU nodes)
