This repo contains dependencies and scripts utilized in the implementation of DNABERT for cell-type predictions from DHS sequences, and downstream analyses. Conda repo created using instructions from https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT?tab=readme-ov-file.

Options in scripts for deep learning using the transformer model were adjusted according to available computational resources (180GB RAM, 1 CPU)

Issues were faced with package dependencies for DNABERT implementation, but I will continue to troubleshoot these issues for the future of this project. Troubleshooting steps that were pursued are reflected in the bash scripts in the troubleshooting directory.
